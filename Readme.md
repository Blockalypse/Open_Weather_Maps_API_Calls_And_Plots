# Open Weather Map API Calls With Python

-------------------------------------------------------

Created a Python script to visualize the weather of cities worldwide at various distances from the equator. City location were randomnly generated using Numpy; and city name were identified using Citipy.  The weather of the relating cities were obtained by making calls to the Open Weather Map API.  All in an effort to make the data discernable with a series of  scatter plots (Matplotlib), which were created to showcase the following relationships: Temp (F) vs. Latitude, Humidity (%) vs Latitude, Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude and Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude.
